Interpretation of Left Femur MRI

FINDINGS:  There is a heterogeneous lesion involving the mid to distal left femoral diaphysis that correlates with the lytic lesion with a narrow zone of transition on the radiographs. The lesion occupies the entire diameter of the medullary canal and 
extends over a superior to inferior extent of approximately 4.6 cm. The lesion is heterogeneous on T1 and T2 weighted sequences and shows heterogeneous enhancement with gadolinium. The lesion is associated with extensive reactive change in the 
surrounding medullary canal that extend over a greater superior to inferior extent measuring approximately 13-14 cm. The lesion is also associated with mild expansion of the medullary canal, cortical thickening and extensive periosteal new bone 
formation. Although there is some lamination of the periosteal new bone formation along the distal aspect of the lesion laterally on the radiographs, the majority of the periosteal new bone formation has benign imaging features. No additional lesions are
 identified.
 
IMPRESSION:
Heterogeneous lytic lesion in the left femoral diaphysis that has imaging features that are most consistent with a Langerhans cell histiocytosis. A CT-guided biopsy would be helpful to confirm this impression.
