most recent hematology and oncology clinical note

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
patient is a 11yr with IgA deficiency and unifocal LCH of the left femur. Most recent PET shows no evidence or recurrence of disease. She will occasionally have pain in the left leg but it doesn't last long. She currently has a runny nose. No fevers or difficulty breathing. A head-to-toe review of systems was otherwise negative, including no history of polyuria/polydipsia. She does not awake at night to urinate, is not incontinent, and does not have excessive need for restroom usage school.
 
She recently had her first menstrual cycle.; no excessive bleeding or concerning symptoms.
 
ONC HX
Persistent left thigh pain for many months in 2023. It was first thought by her providers to be growing pains however the pain did not improve and she began limping by November 2023. An x-ray was performed which demonstrated a lytic lesion in her left femur.

MRI showed a marrow replacing lesion involving the distal third of the femur. She was referred for evaluation at Mayo Clinic for lesion biopsy last December 2023 and pathology results of the biopsy were consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The neoplasm was negative for BRAF by immunohistochemistry.

IMAGING
5/2/24 PET Whole Body:
FINDINGS:  Since the prior PET/CT dated 2/13/2024, interval decreased FDG 
uptake and extent of lytic lesion in the left femoral diaphysis measuring 
approximately 2.5 cm in craniocaudal dimension with an SUV max of 1.7 (PET 
image 335), previously 4 cm in 
craniocaudal dimension with an SUV max of 3.3. 
 
Impression
1. Interval decreased metabolic activity and extent of the biopsy proven left femoral LCH lesion.
2. No new FDG avid LCH involvement.
3. Likely inflammatory focal right lung opacity with mild FDG uptake. 
 
8/27/24 PET Whole Body:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No concerning avidity in the left femoral lesion.
2. No new areas of concerning focal activity elsewhere on the exam. Presumed areas of normal variant heterogeneous marrow activity.
3. Suspected reactive uptake within a morphologically benign-appearing right axillary node. Small focus of activity in the right deltoid region. Correlate for recent injection site.
4. Additional chronic/incidental findings as described.
 
12/23/24 PET Whole Body:
IMPRESSION:
Stable exam without evidence of residual/recurrent disease.
 
IMPRESSION
I have completed a chart review including outside medical documentation, laboratory and imaging studies. 
 
patient is a patient is a 11yr with unifocal LCH of the left femur. Clinically, the process has resolved as pain is gone. The 5/2/24 PET-CT today shows decreasing uptake (SUV 1.7, previously 3.3) in the area of the known femur process. 12/23/24 PET stable with no evidence of recurrent or residual disease. She is growing in height and weight along the previous percentile lines.
 
 
PLAN
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
-Follow-up in 6 months with a physical exam, labs and PET-CT.  


A provided anticipatory guidance to please call back with any pain that lasts more than 1 day and a bony area, the development of nighttime frequent urination, or any new concerns.
