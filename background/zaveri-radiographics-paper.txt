Abstract
Although Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a familiar entity to most radiologists and to pediatric radiologists in particular, it is but one of a group of disorders caused by the overproduction of histiocytes, a subtype of white blood cells. Other less familiar diseases in this category are Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This review describes the classification system, clinical manifestations, and pathophysiology of each disease, with particular attention to differential radiographic findings, including typical locations of involvement and varying appearances at radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and nuclear medicine imaging. Although LCH has a wide variety of manifestations and appearances, classic imaging findings include vertebra plana, skull lesions with a beveled edge, the “floating tooth” sign, bizarre lung cysts, and an absent posterior pituitary bright spot with infundibular thickening. The classic imaging findings of ECD are a perirenal rind of soft tissue and patchy long bone osteosclerosis. RDD has more nonspecific imaging findings, including lymphadenopathy (most commonly cervical) and intracranial lesions. Imaging findings in HLH are broad, with the most common abnormalities being hepatosplenomegaly, cerebral volume loss, and periventricular white matter abnormalities. JXG can manifest at imaging, but radiology does not play a major role in diagnosis. Familiarity with these disorders and their associated imaging findings facilitates correct and timely diagnosis. Imaging also features prominently in the assessment of treatment response.

Introduction
The cells that compose the immune system are derived from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. These cells differentiate into lymphoid and myeloid stem cells. Lymphoid stem cells, after further differentiation, ultimately comprise T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. Myeloid stem cells, on the other hand, ultimately differentiate into erythrocytes, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, megakaryocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. Monocytes further differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, which are important antigen-presenting cells and mediators of host immune defense.

Histiocytic disorders are a group of diseases derived from macrophages and dendritic cells. They result in a wide range of clinical conditions that are restricted primarily to children but can affect adults as well. The World Health Organization’s contemporary classification arranges histiocytic disorders into three groups according to the type of histiocyte involved: dendritic cell disorders, macrophage-related disorders, and malignant histiocytic disorders (1). Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is the most common dendritic cell disorder. Less common diseases in this group include Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) and juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG). Macrophage-related disorders include sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (Rosai-Dorfman disease [RDD]) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Malignant histiocytic disorders include certain leukemias and malignant tumors and will not be discussed here. Each of these diseases is unique, with varying symptoms, diagnostic tests, and treatments. This review describes the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of each disease, with a focus on differential radiologic findings, including common disease locations and appearances at various imaging modalities.

Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis
LCH is the most common dendritic cell disorder and is named because of its similarity to the Langerhans cells found in the skin and mucosa. However, it was later discovered that the abnormal cells in LCH are actually derived from myeloid dendritic cells that exhibit the same antigens (CD1a, S100, and CD207) and exhibit the same unique intracytoplasmic organelles as in Langerhans cells. These intracytoplasmic organelles, known as Birbeck granules, appear racquet-shaped at electron microscopy and help differentiate LCH from other histiocytic disorders and xanthogranulomatous diseases (2,3). The proliferation and accumulation of LCH cells in various organs results in the clinical disease (4).

LCH is divided into three groups on the basis of the number of lesions and systems involved. The unifocal (localized) form is seen in approximately 70% of LCH cases, is limited to a single bone or a few bones, and may involve the lung. Patients usually present between 5 and 15 years of age. The multifocal unisystem (chronic recurring) form comprises approximately 20% of cases and involves multiple bones as well as the reticuloendothelial system (ie, the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and skin). It often is accompanied by diabetes insipidus when the pituitary gland is involved. Patients with this form of disease present earlier than those with unifocal disease, typically between 1 and 5 years of age. The multifocal multisystem (fulminant) form constitutes approximately 10% of LCH cases and often is fatal. It typically is diagnosed in the first 2 years of life and is characterized by disseminated involvement of the reticuloendothelial system, anemia, and thrombocytopenia (5). Eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease, histiocytosis X, and Letterer-Siwe disease are older names for the three groups that were used when LCH was thought to be several different diseases; these names should now be disregarded.

The clinical manifestation of LCH depends on its severity and the number of organs involved and ranges from self-limited to fatal disease (in cases where disease has disseminated to multiple systems) (6). Diagnosis of LCH is made by corroborating clinical features, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and radiologic findings. The radiologic features of LCH are categorized by individual organ systems and are summarized in Table 1 and discussed in detail in the following sections.

Bone Lesions

Teaching Point Bone lesions are the most common radiographic manifestation of LCH and occur in approximately 80% of patients. Although any bone can be affected, LCH has a predilection for the flat bones (5). The skull is the most common flat bone involved, followed by the mandible, ribs, pelvis, and spine.
Skull lesions can be asymptomatic but may manifest with focal pain and soft-tissue swelling in the scalp. The well-defined lytic “punched-out” appearance of skull lesions seen on radiographs is caused by asymmetric destruction of the inner and outer cortices, which results in a characteristic beveled edge (Fig 1) (5). When the temporal bone is affected, the classic location is the mastoid bone, and patients present with swelling, dizziness, vertigo, and otorrhea (7). Unlike other osseous areas with LCH involvement, calvarial disease lacks periosteal reaction. At magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the soft-tissue component is hyperintense on T2-weighted images and isointense on T1-weighted images, with enhancement after gadolinium-based contrast agent administration (Fig 2) (5). Typically, the lesions appear isoechoic at ultrasonography (US). Skull lesions may grow in size and coalesce, creating a maplike appearance referred to as a geographic skull (Fig 3a). The differential diagnosis for calvarial lesions includes epidermoid and dermoid cysts for single lesions and lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and metastases for multiple lesions. Osteomyelitis must also be considered (8,9).

Treatment of single skull lesions includes curettage, curettage with intralesional steroid injection, or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy and oral systemic steroids may be used to treat multiple skull lesions or to prevent CNS extension if the mastoid, temporal, or orbital bones are involved (10,11).

The vertebral body is the most commonly affected part of the spine in LCH. Early lesions appear lytic at radiography and computed tomography (CT). MR imaging demonstrates decreased T1 signal intensity and increased T2 signal intensity, with areas of enhancement (Fig 4). As the disease progresses, the early lytic lesions can result in symmetric uniform collapse of the vertebral body (anterior wedging or unilateral compression is less likely), with preservation of the intervertebral disk spaces (Fig 5a) (5). The flattened vertebral body has been termed vertebra plana and may result in pain and substantial neurologic defects. Spinal deformities are rare. Although vertebra plana can have additional causes in children, such as leukemia, metastatic neuroblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, or Ewing sarcoma, the most common cause in children is LCH (12). Radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for vertebral lesions that are at risk for collapse. Spinal fusion or bracing may be required in patients with neurologic symptoms (13).

Long bone involvement is more common in children than in adults. Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with focal pain and swelling and are at risk for pathologic fractures. The femur, humerus, and tibia are the most commonly involved long bones, and lesions typically occur in the diaphysis or metaphysis. Early lesions often appear lytic, expansile, and aggressive (Fig 6a, 6b). Less aggressive lesions have been associated with imaging findings of cortical thickening and a smooth periosteal reaction (4). CT and MR imaging depict intramedullary lesions with extramedullary soft-tissue components that have decreased T1 signal intensity and increased T2 signal intensity (Fig 6c, 6d). Bone scintigraphy typically shows increased radiotracer uptake (Fig 3d). However, false-negative bone scan findings are not uncommon, particularly in patients with older lesions, and as such should be evaluated in conjunction with radiographic findings (5). As lesions become chronic, they may resolve or appear sclerotic from periosteal new bone formation. A more mature lesion will typically have a sharply defined sclerotic margin (Fig 3c). Chondromyxoid fibromas, plasmacytomas, metastases, and unicameral and aneurysmal bone cysts may have a similar appearance. Because more than 90% of patients with LCH are children, a diagnosis of multiple myeloma or metastases (rather than LCH) should be considered in adults, especially when there are multiple lesions (14). Similar to the treatment of skull lesions, treatment of a single long bone lesion includes curettage with or without intralesional steroid injection or radiation therapy. Multiple lesions may require treatment with chemotherapy and oral systemic steroids (11).

Whereas long bone lesions are more frequently encountered in children, isolated flat bone involvement (most commonly rib or mandibular lesions) is more frequent in adults (Figs 3b, 5). Severe mandibular lesions may destroy the alveolar ridge, resulting in a radiographic appearance of “floating teeth.” In this scenario, patients may present with gingival bleeding and facial swelling (7).

Liver, Spleen, and Lymph Nodes
The liver is involved in approximately 15% of patients with LCH and is considered a “risk organ” that indicates a worse prognosis (2). Findings include hepatomegaly, focal solid or cystlike lesions, and hepatic dysfunction (Fig 7a). Metastases and granulomas can have a similar appearance and manifestation (15). In addition, low attenuation at CT, low echogenicity at US, and low signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MR imaging can be seen along the biliary tracts and portal triads, corresponding with periportal fibrosis (Fig 7a). A potential complication is sclerosing cholangitis, which is progressive and may eventually require liver transplantation (2). The spleen is involved slightly less frequently than the liver and is considered a risk organ as well (2). Splenomegaly can result in cytopenias secondary to hypersplenism. The lymph nodes are involved in approximately 20% of cases and are most commonly seen in the neck but can develop anywhere, manifesting as hard or soft matted groups of nodes with lymphedema (Fig 7b) (2). Treatment includes chemotherapy and steroids when the liver or spleen is involved (11).

CNS Involvement
The CNS is involved in approximately 16% of LCH cases (16). If the facial bones or anterior or middle cranial fossa are affected, the incidence of CNS involvement is higher, affecting up to 25% of patients with LCH (2).

Teaching Point The most common clinical CNS manifestation of LCH is diabetes insipidus secondary to infiltration of the posterior pituitary gland, which results in decreased secretion of antidiuretic hormone. T1-weighted MR imaging demonstrates loss of the normal posterior pituitary bright spot (Fig 8a). Approximately 70% of patients will also show thickening of the pituitary stalk, a finding best appreciated on contrast-enhanced MR images
(Fig 8b) (2). Infiltrative diseases such as germinomas, craniopharyngiomas, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and lymphocytic hypophysitis may also thicken the pituitary stalk (9). More recently, growth hormone deficiency has been recognized as occurring later in life in patients with LCH and diabetes insipidus (17). Patients may also present with ataxia and cognitive dysfunction from neurodegeneration; these lesions are predominantly in the cerebellum and basal ganglia (Fig 8c). At T2-weighted MR imaging, the lesions are hyperintense, with a nonspecific enhancement pattern (7). There are various other potential sites of CNS disease; Prayer et al (18) described white matter changes in a leukoencephalopathy-like pattern, meningeal lesions, and choroid plexus involvement. Treatment includes chemotherapy with or without steroids in cases of active disease with diabetes insipidus. Retinoic acid and intravenous immunoglobulins may be added to the treatment regimen if there are neurodegenerative symptoms (11).

Lung Involvement
Lung involvement occurs in approximately 10% of LCH cases. It is much more common in adults and is almost always associated with smoking (11,19). Patients typically present with shortness of breath and nonproductive cough and sometimes with fever or weight loss. At CT, LCH is characterized by centrilobular micronodules with a predominantly bilateral symmetric upper- to mid-lung distribution; the costophrenic angles are usually spared (Fig 9a). Other diagnoses that should be considered in the setting of nodular LCH include metastases, miliary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and silicosis (20). As the disease progresses, cysts develop and can eventually become the dominant imaging finding (Fig 9b) (19). Cysts vary in size but usually are less than 1 cm. A confluence of cysts may result in bullous formation, which then predisposes the patient to recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. Pleural effusions and enlarged hilar lymph nodes are rare findings (19). Other cystic lung diseases that must be differentiated from pulmonary LCH include lymphangioleiomyomatosis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, and bullous emphysema (20). Treatment of pulmonary LCH involves smoking cessation, as well as chemotherapy and steroids in persistent or progressive cases (11).

Non-LCH Histiocytic Disorders
Non-LCH histiocytic disorders are far less common than LCH and include ECD, JXG, RDD, and HLH. The varying manifestations and imaging findings are presented in the following sections. Table 2 summarizes the most common or typical findings.

Table 2: Review of Non-LCH Disorders

Table 2:
Erdheim-Chester Disease
ECD, first described in 1930 as lipoid granulomatosis, is a rare non-LCH dendritic cell disorder that typically is diagnosed in adulthood, with only several hundred cases reported in the medical literature. ECD cells express CD68 (a histiocytic marker) but do not express CD1a or S100, nor do they contain Birbeck granules; this allows histologic differentiation from the more common LCH (21). Not surprisingly, the clinical manifestations of ECD vary depending on the site of involvement. Nearly all patients (95%) have long bone involvement, with symptoms of periarticular pain most common in the lower extremities; however, asymptomatic bone disease does occur. If there is CNS involvement, diabetes insipidus is a common presenting symptom (as in LCH).


Teaching Point The characteristic radiographic finding in ECD is osseous involvement, which appears as patchy long bone medullary osteosclerosis in the metadiaphyseal region, with epiphyseal sparing
(Fig 10a) (21). At T2-weighted MR imaging, bone lesions manifest as patchy areas of signal hyperintensity. In addition, most patients will have at least one extraosseous manifestation (22). Retroperitoneal findings are reported in 29% of patients and include a retroperitoneal mass or characteristic perirenal rind of soft tissue with a hairy appearance (Fig 10b, 10c), a finding that usually is asymptomatic but can cause impingement on the renal vasculature or collecting system (Fig 11) (23). Differential considerations for retroperitoneal and/or perirenal soft-tissue abnormalities are lymphoma and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Aortic involvement has been reported as circumferential soft tissue surrounding the abdominal aorta, with an appearance similar to that of vasculitis (23). CNS manifestations are also common and include extra-axial masses, particularly in the sellar region (Fig 10d, 10e); a retro-orbital infiltration or mass resulting in exophthalmos; and pachymeningeal thickening (24,25). Extra-axial masses can mimic meningiomas at imaging; interestingly, one study demonstrated delayed enhancement of extra-axial masses of up to 8 days, a finding thought to be related to the persistent uptake of gadolinium contrast agent by histiocytes (26). Cardiac involvement can result in fibrosis, pericardial thickening or effusion, and cardiomyopathy. Pulmonary disease is less common, with findings that vary from mediastinal infiltration to centrilobular nodules to lung cysts (23,27). Although it is uncommon, pulmonary involvement contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality (27).

Treatment includes close observation (in mild disease), interferon therapy, or chemotherapy. Surgical or percutaneous intervention is useful for symptomatic local disease (such as hydronephrosis) or intracranial or orbital involvement that causes mass effect on vital structures. Pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac failure are the most common causes of death (28).

Juvenile Xanthogranuloma
JXG is a relatively benign, non-LCH, dendritic cell disorder of early childhood, with the majority of patients presenting before 1 year of age (29). The most common manifestations are dermal; patients present with a small yellow-reddish papule, plaque, or nodule early in the disease process (30). The skin lesions will usually spontaneously regress, most commonly within a few years of presentation (30). The head, neck, and upper trunk are common locations for JXG skin lesions. Other organ systems affected by JXG include the subcutaneous and deep soft tissues (Fig 12). Systemic lesions may also be seen in the liver, spleen, lung, bones (Fig 13), lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract (30).

The diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of typical dermal findings. Occasionally, biopsy and immunostaining of dermal lesions are needed (30). Biopsy shows aggregates of benign-appearing histiocytes with infrequent Touton giant cells (lipid-laden multinucleated histiocytes). The radiologic appearance of systemic JXG is entirely nonspecific and is used only when there is clinical concern for systemic involvement.

Treatment depends on the disease extent and severity. No treatment is needed for cutaneous or soft-tissue lesions, as these often regress spontaneously (8). These patients are often observed without therapy. Most extracutaneous and systemic lesions will also spontaneously regress, and only rare cases of mortality have been reported. If necessary, treatment may include resection, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

Rosai-Dorfman Disease
RDD, also known by the more descriptive name sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare disorder characterized by macrophage proliferation and was first described in 1969 (31). There is a slight male predominance, with children and young adults most commonly affected; there also is a predilection for individuals of African descent (32).

Teaching Point The most common manifestation of RDD is nonspecific painless lymphadenopathy (most often cervical and less commonly retroperitoneal, mediastinal, axillary, or inguinal) accompanied by fever, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and mild anemia.
The characteristic histopathologic feature is emperipolesis, in which histiocytes phagocytize lymphocytes, plasma cells, erythrocytes, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (33). The histiocytes consistently show S100 positivity but are CD1a negative and lack Birbeck granules.
The imaging appearance of the lymphadenopathy is nonspecific (Fig 14a). Uptake of gallium and FDG in the abnormal lymph nodes has been shown (Fig 14b, 14c) (34,35). Extranodal disease occurs in nearly half of patients and can involve nearly every organ system, with the head and neck being the most common sites of involvement (33). CNS manifestations include intracranial lesions primarily in the epidural or subdural compartments; as with extra-axial lesions in ECD, these lesions can be confused with meningiomas at imaging (Fig 15). It has been suggested that low T2 signal intensity in an extra-axial lesion can help differentiate RDD from meningioma, which typically has high T2 signal intensity (36,37). Interestingly, the majority of patients with CNS disease do not have lymphadenopathy. Paranasal sinus disease manifests at imaging as enhancing polypoid masses or mucosal thickening and may appear aggressive (38). Salivary gland lymphoid hyperplasia is also common at presentation (33). The orbits are also a well-documented site of involvement, often unilateral, with an extraconal soft-tissue mass being the most common orbital manifestation. Bone involvement is typically in the form of multicentric lytic lesions. Essentially any bone in the body can be affected; however, the most commonly described locations are the skull, tibia, and femur (39). At radiography and CT, bone lesions are medullary and lytic, with variable presence of a sclerotic margin, and can easily be confused with the lesions of LCH (Fig 16) (37). Purely sclerotic osseous lesions have been reported but are considered unusual (40). Intrathoracic RDD may rarely manifest as a lung mass (41).

Although the prognosis varies from patient to patient, RDD has an overall good prognosis, with many patients having an indolent clinical course and even spontaneous resolution. Therefore, the need for treatment remains uncertain, and treatment is likely unnecessary in most cases. If treatment is deemed necessary because of vital organ involvement or complications, the mainstay is surgical resection. Radiation therapy and long-term corticosteroid therapy have been used with mixed results, while chemotherapy has generally proven ineffective (42). Of note, extranodal disease correlates with a worse prognosis.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis
HLH is an additional macrophage-related disorder characterized by an excess of lymphocytes and activated macrophages, typically with hemophagocytosis, in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes (43). As in RDD, the histiocytes do not stain for CD1a. The disease is divided into primary (familial) and secondary forms. The primary form (approximately 25% of all cases) is seen in infants and is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. The secondary form is seen in older children and adults and is associated with infection and prolonged immunosuppression. The natural course of the disease varies from relapsing and remitting to rapidly progressive.

Teaching Point Currently, diagnosis of HLH requires five of the following eight criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia of at least two cell lineages, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hyperfibrinogenemia, tissue hemophagocytosis, low and/or absent natural killer cell activity, hyperferritinemia, and high-soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels
(43). Because the presenting symptoms are nonspecific, initial diagnosis is often delayed; rarely, a diagnosis of HLH is not considered until postmortem examination. Recently, serum ferritin levels greater than 10,000 µg/L have been shown to be 90% sensitive and 96% specific for the diagnosis of HLH (44).
As with the clinical manifestation, many of the imaging findings are nonspecific but can assist in diagnosis and disease monitoring. Neurologic symptoms, including seizures, altered consciousness, hemiparesis, ataxia, and nuchal rigidity, are some of the more common manifestations and may clinically mimic encephalitis. At brain MR imaging, typical findings include white matter foci with increased T2 signal intensity, leptomeningeal enhancement, and cerebral volume loss (which can lead to dilated ventricles and prominent extra-axial fluid) (Fig 17) (45,46). Calcifications favoring the gray-white junction can be seen at CT (44). Chest radiographs may demonstrate interstitial opacities with or without pleural effusions (45). Nonspecific abdominal abnormalities include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly (Fig 18), gallbladder wall thickening, ascites, lymphadenopathy, periportal echogenicity, nephromegaly, and increased renal cortical echogenicity (47).

HLH left untreated can be fatal. Initial treatment has been unified with the advent of the HLH-2004 treatment protocol, which includes etoposide, dexamethasone, and cyclosporine A, with corticosteroids and intrathecal methotrexate therapy reserved for use in selected patients. Hematopoietic cell transplantation is used in patients with familial disease or severe, persistent, or reactivated disease (43).

Conclusion
Histiocytic disorders have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and radiologic appearances. Although many imaging appearances are nonspecific, familiarity with and knowledge of these disorders will facilitate their inclusion in the differential diagnosis. Imaging findings that are more specific (although not diagnostic) include lytic skull lesions with beveled edges, vertebra plana, and pituitary infundibular thickening in LCH, and patchy medullary osteosclerosis and perirenal soft tissue in ECD. Radiology plays a large role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with histiocytic diseases. Familiarity with the typical imaging appearances of histiocytic disorders is crucial for appropriate patient management.
